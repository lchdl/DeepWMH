* You need to provide a labeled image describing the tissue type of each voxel.
This information is used as anatomical priors to help train the network later.
    0: background;
    1: cerebrum (without cortex);
    2: cerebellum and brainstem;
    3: cerebral cortex.
"Brain_label.nii.gz" shows an example of this. 

* The anatomical priors above can be generated by common brain segmentation tools 
such as 
    1) FSL (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) and 
    2) FreeSurfer (https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). 
"./Brain_FreeSurfer_aseg.nii.gz" is an example of coarse brain segmentation 
using FreeSurfer 6.0.0 (about 3.5h per subject).
